* 1.5 April 2014 - added #define for port id
*
* Description:
*
* This program runs on an Arduino processor with a WIFI shield. 
* This program is a client demo. This runs in a loop communicating
* with a server process that also runs in a loop. The protocol is
* that after we connect to a server, this process sends three '\n'
* terminated strings. The final string is "bye\n" which is a 
* signal to the server that we are done sending data. Then
* this process waits for the server to send a single string back. This illustrates basic client
* server connection and two-way communication.
*
* Compilation and Execution Instructions: Only Compile using 
* Arduino IDE VERSION 1.0.4
*
* Parameters: None
*
* Internal Methods: void printConnectionStatus()
